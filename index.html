                    <p>Media Queries is a CSS3 module allowing content rendering to adapt to conditions such as screen resolution (e.g. smartphone screen vs. computer screen). It became a W3C recommended standard in June 2012, and is a cornerstone technology of Responsive web design.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>By starting mobile first with your responsive website you are able to make the tough decisions about the content. Mobile first often lends itself to a linear layout model, although this is a general truth and not necessarily a rule.</p>
                    <p>The great thing about this approach is it forces you into a content hierarchy. The most important piece of content is on top, followed by the next, followed by the next. Unlike a desktop approach where you can put two pieces of content side by side for equal footing, a
                    mobile approach means one is above the other.</p>

                        <p>Typography is where your design begins, so it is important to ensure that it responds responsibly. With 95% of the web made up from
                        type it's important to get it right.</p>

                    <p>Breakpoints are the point a which your sites content will respond to provide the user with the best possible layout to consume the information.</p>
                    <p>When you first begin to work with Responsive Design you will define your breakpoints at the exact device widths that you are looking to target. Most often these are the smart phone (usually the iPhone at 320px and 480px), the tablet (usually the iPad at 768px and 1024px) and
                    finally anything above 1024px.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Responsive design is about a single source of content across many viewports and, therefore, requires the content up front for a truly award winning design that spans a million devices.</p>
                    <p>During the build of this site I had a really good idea upfront as to what I wanted each of the pages should contains, which modules were to be added to each page and what those content modules were made up from. With all this knowledge I was sure I considered everything for
                    the page layouts and wireframes to provide the designer when designing this site.</p>
                    <p>In reality it was a flawed process. The designs that the designer came back with were great, but they didn't account for the small issues. Length of headlines that spanned multiple lines, the layout of a page that is too short and conversely one that is longer than most.</p>
                    <p>When you ask a designer to design without the content that will be used for the final site you may as well be asking an architect to design a house without specifying the number of bedrooms, ensuites,kitchens and bathrooms.</p>
                    <p>Make no mistake, a design constructed without real content may look alright in the end, but it will never be as good or impressive than a design with actual content.</p>
